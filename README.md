# Flashcard App
For kids, learning through flashcards is a great way to simplify and present information. Our flashcard set teaches the alphabet, numbers, word definitions, and even includes the ability to create custom flashcards.

## How it Works
Users can click a button that contains the topic they want to learn. This will load the flashcard deck that the user can click through to hear the content of the flashcard and flip to see the answer. This simple functionality keeps users easily engaged and able to learn a mulitutde of topics rather easy.

## APIs Used
WordsAPI: https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/
    - Words API retrieves information about English words, including definitions, synonyms, rhymes, pronunciation, syllables, and frequency of usage. This API serves as our library of teachable concepts.

GeoDB Cities API: https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/
    - GeoDB has an extensive amount of data on global cities, states, countries, and regions. This allouwed us to create our most challenging deck: flashcards on cities and their capitals.

## WireFrame
![original-project-outline](./assets/images/WireFrame1%20copy.png)
Our original wireframe includes a header, aside, and body section. Our aside serves as the menu for topics and custom cards. Our main section displays the current flashcard with the option to flip through its question and answer.

## Future Features

With this project currently being about proof of concept, future deployments may include more features. These features may include a more detailed cirriculum and even miscellaneous categories like famous movies and their quotes.
